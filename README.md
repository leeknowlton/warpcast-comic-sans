# Comic Sans on Warpcast

A simple Chrome extension that transforms all fonts on the Warpcast Comic Sans channel (`/comic-sans`) into Comic Sans MS.

## Description

This Chrome extension automatically applies Comic Sans MS font to all text when visiting the Comic Sans channel on Warpcast (`https://warpcast.com/~/channel/comic-sans`). It's a fun way to make the Comic Sans channel live up to its name!

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory

## How It Works

The extension uses a simple CSS injection to change fonts on the specified Warpcast page. It only activates when you visit the Comic Sans channel, so it won't affect your browsing experience elsewhere on Warpcast.
